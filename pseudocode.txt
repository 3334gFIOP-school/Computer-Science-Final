Have 3 menus, one for playlist editing, a main menu, and a music player menu. Each one has appropriate UI for that section.

- Music playing
Play and pause, fast forward and rewind, skip song and choose a playlist to play music from (shuffle option too).

- Playlist editing
Allow them to remove playlists, remove songs from the playlist, add songs to a playlist, create a playlist, and just show the songs in the playlist.

- Main menu
Just show a welcome screen.
